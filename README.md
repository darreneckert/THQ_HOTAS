# THQ_HOTAS
My asttempt to add additional controls to the VKB Throttle Quadrant module, using Marco_596178's Printables throttle bodies (https://www.printables.com/model/405514-vkb-thq-hotas-throttle)

I plan to use one or two Arduino Pro Micro boards to add a mini joystick, various buttons, hats and switches to the 3D printed bodies designed by Marco_596178 and release on the Printables website.

This repository will contain the Arduino code, schematics and documentation for this project.
