# THQ_HOTAS
My attempt to add additional controls to the VKB Throttle Quadrant module (THQ).

I plan to use one or two Arduino Pro Micro boards to add a mini joystick, various buttons, hats and switches to the VKB THQ using Marco_596178's Printables throttle bodies (https://www.printables.com/model/405514-vkb-thq-hotas-throttle) and Huzarski's hat switches (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3641494)

This is my first time using an Arduino and working on a DIY Hotas.

This repository will contain the Arduino code, schematics and documentation for this project.
